              <span>
                After roughly ten years of professional experience, it feels like I've done a little bit of just about everything!
                Well, definitely not everything, but from Christian ministry to e-learning development, to Autism therapy, to energy trading, 
                to database management - a wide variety for sure! Through it all, a few prominent trends and patterns have emerged that describe
                well what I bring to the table.

              <span><b>I am:</b></span>
              <br>
              <span>
                <b>Analytical</b> 
                I absolutely love analyzing complex systems, data sets, people, and situations to try to make
                sense of it all and tell a "story" that might lead to insight.</span>

                <br>
                <span><b>A Problem-Solver</b> 
                  To me, a problem is simply an opportunity wating to happen!  I revel at the opportunity
                  to apply detailed analysis to understanding complex problems and generating viable solutions.</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span>
                    <b>Creative</b> 
                    Yea, I write a little and play a little guitar (poorly), but that's not what I mean here.
                    Again and again I have found that solutions to technical problems can be creative - beautiful even!
                  </span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>
                      <b>A Servant</b> 
                      Solving a problem is extremely satisfying all its own - but all the more when someone 
                      can benefit from the solution. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning - the hope for the opportunity 
                      to use my unique set of skills, abilities, and experiences to make life better for someone.
